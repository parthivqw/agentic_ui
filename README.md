🤖 Agentic UI - Multi-Agent AI Orchestrator

A sophisticated AI agent routing system that intelligently delegates tasks to specialized agents without heavy frameworks

🌟 What Makes This Special?
Zero Heavy Dependencies - Built without LangChain, n8n, or other orchestration frameworks. Pure Python intelligence routing with custom BERT models and dynamic agent dispatch.
Intelligent Agent Routing - Uses Claude/GPT-4o for intent detection and automatically routes requests to specialized agents based on context and requirements.
Multi-Modal AI Pipeline - Seamlessly combines LLMs (Claude, GPT-4o, LLaMA), computer vision (Imagen 4), and custom BERT models for sales intent prediction.
🎯 Supported AI Agents

🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive
Core Routing Logic
User Input → Claude Intent Detection → App Registry Lookup → Specialized Agent → Response
Agent Registry System
The system uses a dynamic app_registry.json to register and route to different agents:
json{
  "Poster Generator": {
    "entrypoint": "poster_agent.run",
    "required_fields": ["main_prompt", "theme", "include_hero_headline", ...]
  },
  "Lead/Sales Intent Generator": {
    "entrypoint": "sales_agent.run",
    "required_fields": ["conversation", "predicted_intent"]
  }
}
Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline
1. Intent Detection & App Recommendation

Uses Claude/GPT-4o to understand user intent
Dynamically selects the most appropriate agent
Validates against registry for supported agents

2. Payload Generation

Converts raw user input into structured agent-specific payloads
Handles field mapping and validation using Pydantic models
Optimizes prompts for downstream AI models

3. Specialized Agent Execution

Poster Agent: Multi-stage content generation → visual prompt building → image generation
Sales Agent: BERT-based intent prediction → conversational AI recommendations
Each agent returns standardized response format for UI rendering

🔧 Technical Highlights
Custom BERT Model Integration

Fine-tuned BERT model for sales intent classification
8-class prediction with confidence scoring
Real-time inference with PyTorch optimization

Dynamic Prompt Engineering

Adaptive prompt construction based on agent requirements
Token-aware field generation (hero_headline: 12 tokens, description: 25 tokens)
Visual-aware prompt building for image generation

Modular Agent System

Clean separation of concerns between routing and execution
Easy to add new agents by updating registry
Standardized response format across all agents

Production-Ready Frontend

Real-time typing indicators and smooth animations
Base64 image rendering with error handling
Responsive design with glassmorphism effects
Debug information for development

🎮 Usage Examples
Generate a Marketing Poster
Input: "Create a poster for a Python bootcamp with job placement stats"
→ Routes to Poster Agent
→ Generates content fields via LLaMA
→ Creates visual prompt
→ Generates image via Imagen 4
→ Returns base64 image + structured data
Analyze Sales Conversation
Input: "Day 1: Hi, interested in your course...
        Day 2: What's the price?
        Day 3: That seems expensive..."
→ Routes to Sales Agent  
→ Cleans and structures conversation
→ Predicts intent via BERT: "Price Concern"
→ Generates recommendation via LLaMA
→ Returns actionable next steps
🔮 Why This Approach?
